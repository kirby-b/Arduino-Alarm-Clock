# Arduino-Alarm-Clock
Files needed for building an alarm clock with an arduino. This includes all the nessary code and a helpful wiring diagram(some parts had to be done outside tinkercad so it has some slightly weird bits)

To run this code you will also need the RTClib and LiquidCrystal libraries. They can be downloaded in the offical Arduino IDE or they can be found here
* [RTC](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/rt-clib)
* [LiquidCrystal](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/liquid-crystal)
